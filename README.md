# 🌾 Minor Irrigation Census Analysis – Uttar Pradesh 💧

## Project Overview

This project leverages **Big Data Analytics** using **Apache Spark** ✨ and **PySpark** to process and analyze the **Minor Irrigation Census data** for Uttar Pradesh. The primary objective is to uncover key insights into **irrigation efficiency** and **groundwater stress trends** across 12,938 villages to support data-driven agricultural and water management decisions. 🧑‍🌾

## Key Features and Objectives

* **Big Data Processing:** Efficiently analyze large-scale irrigation data (12,938 records) using the distributed computing framework of Apache Spark. 🚀
* **Data Validation:** Clean, validate, and analyze 19 key water and irrigation metrics to ensure data integrity. ✅
* **Performance:** Achieved up to **$50\times$ faster computation** using Spark's distributed processing over traditional methods. ⚡
* **Actionable Insights:** Identify district-wise irrigation efficiency and regions facing significant groundwater stress. 📊

## Technical Stack 🛠️

The analysis was performed using the following tools and technologies:

* **Distributed Processing:** Apache Spark 3.0+
* **Programming Language:** PySpark (Python API for Apache Spark) and Python 3.8+
* **Interactive Environment:** Jupyter Notebook 📓
* **Data Handling & Visualization:** Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn 📈
* **Dataset:** Minor Irrigation Census (Uttar Pradesh, 12,938 villages)

## Key Findings and Insights 🎯

The analysis yielded critical findings for water resource management in Uttar Pradesh:

* **Top-Performing Districts (100% Coverage):** Aligarh, Etawah, Shahjahanpur, and Unnao. ⭐
* **High-Stress Regions:** Maharajganj and Jaunpur, indicating significant groundwater depletion. ⚠️
* **Water Stress Distribution:** The analysis showed that **62.3%** of the observed distribution falls under **High Stress**. 🚨
* **Correlation:** A strong correlation was found between irrigation efficiency and sustainable groundwater levels. 🔗

## Conclusion

This project successfully implemented a **Big Data workflow** using PySpark to transform raw census data into **actionable policy insights** for Uttar Pradesh. By combining scalable computation, accurate data processing, and visualization, this work establishes a robust framework for future agricultural analytics and informed decision-making in water governance. 🌱
